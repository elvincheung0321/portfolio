    description: I love basketball! I started training at age 6, despite there never being a boys’ basketball team at my school. My school finally opened a boys’ basketball team when I was in primary 6 (Grade 6), and I immediately became a key player. I was even invited by another school to join their district competition. I continue to be a key player on the secondary school team, which consists of Form 1 and Form 2 students. I organize a basketball team for my class for inter-class competitions. Outside of school, I am a member of an elite U13 team (Fun Basketball), participating in many competitions while maintaining my weekly private training. This summer, I attended a Sports Broadcasting camp in Boston to learn more about college and professional sports. I completed a coaching course with Positive Coaching Alliance. I continued to go back to my elementary school to train with my underclassmen since graduating, and this summer, I assisted the basketball coach with the team’s training. This year, I am glad to be the school’s basketball team captain and a member of the basketball club committee.

        Youth Leadership Training Program:
        I participated in a youth leadership training program this summer. The entire program lasts three months, from June to August, starting with participant evaluation, orientation, an overnight training camp, event organization, and ending with the event day itself. The training camp held workshops covering vital skills such as communication, negotiation and compromise, time management, planning and organization, and team building. My team designed a city scavenger hunt with family bonding activities at the youth community center. It took us a month to meet and plan, take a field trip to try out the route, and prepare for the day of the event.

        Life Science Laboratory:
        I participated in a Life Science Laboratory project this summer to create engaging science experiments and develop leadership skills. Our goal was to inspire young children to explore science. My teammate and I successfully designed an electromagnetic crane model. The project took one month of research, planning, preparing the presentation, and building the model. While building the model, we encountered numerous problem-solving challenges, including wiring issues, battery strength, and insufficient copper wire. On that day, we presented our project, explained the theory behind it, and showcased our model to our young participants.
