    description: I love basketball! I started training at age 6, despite there never being a boys’ basketball team at my school. My school finally opened a boys’ basketball team when I was in primary 6 (Grade 6), and I immediately became a key player. I was even invited by another school to join their district competition. I continue to be a key player on the secondary school team, which consists of Form 1 and Form 2 students. I organize a basketball team for my class for inter-class competitions. Outside of school, I am a member of an elite U13 team (Fun Basketball), participating in many competitions while maintaining my weekly private training. This summer, I attended a Sports Broadcasting camp in Boston to learn more about college and professional sports. I completed a coaching course with Positive Coaching Alliance. I continued to go back to my elementary school to train with my underclassmen since graduating, and this summer, I assisted the basketball coach with the team’s training. This year, I am glad to be the school’s basketball team captain and a member of the basketball club committee.
